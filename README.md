# Solar-PAYGo-Payment-Prediction

Solar Frontier Capital (SFC) is an impact investment firm that provides essential financing to Pay-as-you-go (PAYGo) Solar Home System distributors across Africa. By bridging the financing gap, SFC empowers these distributors to scale their operations and offer renewable energy solutions to underserved communities. This model enables African households to access affordable, off-grid solar energy, reducing reliance on fossil fuels and improving quality of life.

This project involves forecasting the next six months of payments for PAYGo customers. Accurate predictions enable PAYGo distributors to optimize their services, providing timely support to customers while maintaining affordability. By leveraging Machine Learning, this initiative helps ensure the financial sustainability of PAYGo systems, which are a transformative solution for addressing Africaâ€™s energy access challenges.
